# Estimation of Obesity Levels Based on Eating Habits and Physical Condition

## Introduction/Description
This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict obesity levels from eating habits and physical conditions. Aimed at health professionals and data scientists, the analysis uses a dataset to explore the impact of various factors on obesity and develop predictive models that could potentially assist in medical assessments and public health strategies.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Installation
Follow these steps to get your development environment running:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>


## Usage
To run this project, follow these steps:
```bash
jupyter notebook Machine_Learning_ObesityLevelsPrediction.ipynb
```
Inside the notebook, execute the cells sequentially to perform the analysis from data loading through to model evaluation.

## Analysis Overview
The analysis pipeline includes:
- **Data Exploration**: Understanding feature distributions and identifying patterns.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data and preparing it for the machine learning models.
- **Model Selection**: Comparing various algorithms to find the best performer for our specific dataset.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics like accuracy and F1-score to evaluate the model's performance.
Key findings reveal how specific eating habits and physical conditions correlate strongly with obesity levels, providing insights into potential areas for public health intervention.

## Contributing
We encourage you to contribute to this project. If you have suggestions for improving the analysis or feature enhancements, please:
1. Fork the project repository.
2. Create a branch for your feature (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some YourFeature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
5. Create a new Pull Request.

## Conclusion
This machine learning project not only sheds light on the factors contributing to obesity but also demonstrates the practical application of data science in healthcare. Further research and development can extend this work to include more predictive factors and potentially real-time data processing for dynamic recommendations.
